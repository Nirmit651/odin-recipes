        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degress C).</li>
            <li>Line a 13x9x2-inch baking pan with heavy-duty foil, allowing 2 inches of 
                overhang on two opposite sides of the pan. Coat foil lightly with nonstick 
                cooking spray; set aside.</li>
            <li>Place 30 cookies in a food processor.</li> 
            <li>Add melted butter and pulse just until combined</li>  
            <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared pan. Press crumbs evenly into the bottom of 
                the pan.</li> 
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl and beat with an 
                electric mixer on high until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add sour cream, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Beat until just combined.</li>
            <li>Coarsely crush the remaining oreos by placing them in a resealable bag and 
                hitting it with a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs. Fold the remaining crumbs into the batter.</li>
            <li>Pour batter evenly over prebaked crust, smoothing the top as necessary.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center appears set, with a slight jiggle, 35 
                to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cool in a pan on a wire rack for 2 hours, or until completely cool. Cover and chill 
                for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove uncut bars from the pan by lifting foil.</li>
            <li>Cut into 2x2-inch bars to serve.</li>
        </ol>
