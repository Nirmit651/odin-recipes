    <img src="../images/brownies.webp" alt="A picture of cookies and cream brownies">
    <p>Soft and gooey on the inside, crisp on the outside dark chocolate brownies are 
        topped with a layer of creamy topping and crushed cookies in this decadent but 
        easy dessert.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>32 chocolate sandwich cookies, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip), thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the 
            flour mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with a spatula. Add 
            16 OREO® cookies in an even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies), then spread the remaining 1/2 
            of the batter over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let brownies cool completely, at least 30 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Crush 12 of the remaining OREO® cookies. Place the whipped topping in a bowl and fold in 
            the crushed cookies. Spread over the top of the brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies, 
            then sprinkle over the top of the whipped cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Keep refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
